# PassageClock: Relative Time Lines

Inspired by Justice whose preferred clock displays the percentage of the day now past.

Started as a clone of [@robertmermet's](http://robertmermet.com/) [Percent Clock](https://github.com/robertmermet/percentclock/)

## [Live demo](https://passageclock.now.sh/)

## TODO

- [x] let users choose a color scheme
- [x] allow users to remove time slices
- [ ] allow time origin adjustment for timers, i.e. time from now, time till then
- [x] alias the now.sh demo for permanent linking
