# Passage

It's a clock that's super hard to read :)

It's the unfortunate lovechild of a fidget spinner, a higgs boson, \
and an alarm clock radio.

## Installation

To run it locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/krry/passage-clock.git
cd passage-clock && yarn add
yarn dev
```

## Optional Dependencies

A few packages that are helpful when installed globally:

```
yarn global add eslint webpack webpack-cli stylelint
```

## Usage

You'll figure it out. If you break it, please let me know in an [issue](https://github.com/krry/passage-clock/issues).
